While other topics may sound more relevant for humanity, this is a story that communicates how much the person who worked on it is passionate about the topic and how interesting he has made it for others. The narration flows in a way that guides you if you don’t know much about the topic, but still lets you explore and get to the fine detail if you care deeply about it. It brings up the little anecdotes and details that makes this dataset more interesting and even funny, in a way that is not intrusive or feels artificial. <span class=judge>— Chiqui Esteban</span>

Sarah Crespi and Jia You took readers on a beautifully visualized and illustrated tour of why they’re shaped precisely the way they are. Through video, gifs, and charts, and illustrations, the pair explained how studying 50,000 eggs helped scientists understand the relationship between egg length and bird size, as well as link between egg shape and different bird flying habits."},{year:"2017",award:"staff picks",tier:"winner",title:"Can we talk about the gender pay gap?",author:"<a href=https://twitter.com/xocasgv>Xaquín G.V.</a>",organization:"<a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/>Washington Post</a>",link:"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/business/women-pay-gap/",broken:"",image:"gendergap.jpg",alt:"a conneted scatterplot that shows the gender pay gap. the number of men per profession are represented by a proportional yellow circle. the number of women per profession are represented by a proportional purple cirle. these two circles are connected a magenta line that represented the pay gap. jobs with more women are toward the left and jobs with more men are toward the right. the gender pay gap for pharmacists is $2.70 per hour, for lawyers and other judicial workers it is $9.93 per hour, and for dentists it is $16.97 per hour.",comment:"The gender pay gap has been visualized many times. But what’s unique about Xaquín’s approach is the use of a clever hook, “The median salary for women working full-time is about 80 percent of men’s. That gap, put in other terms, means women are working for free 10 weeks a year.” He then uses hand-drawn visuals and graphics to nail this point: time-spent working for free.
