While other topics may sound more relevant for humanity, this is a story that communicates how much the person who worked on it is passionate about the topic and how interesting he has made it for others. The narration flows in a way that guides you if you don’t know much about the topic, but still lets you explore and get to the fine detail if you care deeply about it. It brings up the little anecdotes and details that makes this dataset more interesting and even funny, in a way that is not intrusive or feels artificial. <span class=judge>— Chiqui Esteban</span>
