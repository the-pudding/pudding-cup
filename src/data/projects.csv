2022,passion,winner,"All the Ways to Make Bubble Tea, Taiwan's Pearl-fect Drink","Julia Janicki, Daisy Chung",,https://taiwandatastories.com/bubble-tea-guide/,,https://pudding.cool/process/pudding-cup-2022/assets/images/tea.jpg,"This piece took a simple question – how many unique bubble tea drinks are there in Taiwan? – and executed it delightfully. There’s so much information, but the illustrations and the personalized framing help you easily traverse it all. I am boba-obsessed, but I tend to stick with the same thing (jasmine milk tea, 50% sweet, light ice, boba), and this piece inspired me to try something new next time. — Michelle McGhee"
2022,passion,winner,Flags of Inequality,"Rita Costa, Beatriz Malveiro",,https://www.flags-of-inequality.com/,,https://pudding.cool/process/pudding-cup-2022/assets/images/flags.jpg,"The subject matter and the design collide with so much thoughtfulness and intention in this piece on LGBTQ+ rights in Europe. I keep looking at the rectangles and being amazed that those simple shapes hold so much meaning: the connection to the queer community, how each stripe is a building block for complete representation, and how the absence of color equals the absence of rights. The big idea behind this piece is so well done, but it’s also packed with so many small details — like how the flags reshuffle — that make the user experience more engaging. I like to consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of queer data projects, and this one is going to stay with me for a long time. — Jan Diehm"
2022,passion,winner,K-Means Clustering: An Explorable Explainer,Yi Zhe Ang,,https://k-means-explorable.vercel.app/,,https://pudding.cool/process/pudding-cup-2022/assets/images/k-means.jpg,"I enjoyed everything about this explainer. I know a technical explainer is only meant for a specific audience, but it was done in a gentle and inviting way. It was clear that every piece of it was thoughtfully considered. The prose was both clear and approachable, the design was simple and clean, and the interactions were playful. There was also a nice balance of passive and active user experience. I appreciated the subtle additions, like toggling to the algorithm view, or dragging the edge handles for deeper control. All-in-all, it was a winner for me because it was able to teach me something in a pleasantly engaging way. — Russell Samora"

2021,passion,winner,Waterworks,"Queenie Wu, Leslie Xin",,http://waterworks.digital/,TRUE,https://pudding.cool/process/pudding-cup-2021/assets/images/waterworks.jpg,"Despite the atypical subject matter, we all had a similar spark of joy for the brilliance of Waterworks’ concept when first opening the link. Crying at college could have easily been a topic explained in a thousand-word article. However, actually seeing the flood of locations students have cried on campus (in this case, the University of Waterloo) not only makes you understand the topic, but the map-based visualization makes you feel the weight of the topic’s implications (students and academic pressure / stress; even more broadly, young people and mental health). You could say we at The Pudding of all people are suckers for a nuanced topic shown beautifully rather than told verbosely (in fact, it’s kind of our whole thing). – Caitlyn Ralph"
2021,passion,winner,American Wilderness,Spenser A. Krut,,https://centerforspatialresearch.github.io/fall2021_data_visualization/final/wilderness-main/index.html,,https://pudding.cool/process/pudding-cup-2021/assets/images/wilderness.jpg,"It’s rare for projects to tackle topics that have received scant coverage, but we were intrigued by the questions this analysis of American wilderness suggested. How much of the land in the country can be considered wild? What is wilderness, exactly? And, since this land is managed by the US government, what does it mean for various departments to be responsible for its administration? – Ilia Blinderman"
2021,passion,winner,How We Gaze,Omar Nema,,http://omarnema.com/how-we-gaze/public/index.html,,https://omarnema.com/parsons-studio-1/qual/gaze-study-svelte/public/,"How We Gaze is an opportunity to see things from another’s perspective, quite literally. Using crowdsourced eye-tracking data, we’re invited to consider what someone else found most eye-catching about an artwork. Where does their gaze linger? What do they ignore? Do others follow the same path? There’s even an opportunity to contribute your own point of view with the aid of your webcam. As a panel, we found this to be a compelling application of the data, and a subtle way to engender empathy, if only for a few fleeting glances. – Rob Smith"
2021,passion,honorable mention,River Runner,Sam Learner,,https://river-runner-global.samlearner.com/,,,"The premise is simple: let a raindrop fall anywhere in the world and watch its travels. Its execution, however, draws the reader in and leads to questions about the world’s vast network of waterways. It’s rare for a project with so few words to give rise to so many cultural, ecological, and geographical considerations. – IB"
2021,passion,honorable mention,Loud Numbers: a data sonification podcast,"Miriam Quick, Duncan Geere",,https://www.loudnumbers.net/,,,"Using data to make creative, yet coherent visualizations is hard enough; imagine trying to make music from it. That’s the daunting task that the makers of Loud Numbers undertake in every episode of their podcast, often with resounding success. The “Boom & Bust” and “The End of the Road” episodes are especially captivating sonifications. – RS"

2021,passion,honorable mention,All The Passes,Karim Douieb,,https://observablehq.com/@karimdouieb/all-the-passes,,,"They call it “the beautiful game,” so naturally Karim’s depiction of every pass from 890 football matches looks great. The viz is both simple and satisfying; scrolling around it is a couple minutes well spent. – Kevin Litman-Navarro"
2021,passion,honorable mention,NBA Recordigami,Narro,,https://narro.design/html/nba-recordigami.html,,,"This was a great example of choosing the right form for your idea. The triangle visual stacks unlikely records near the outer ends, and the temporal color scale drives home the point that applies outside of basketball — the more times you try something, the more you will see rare outcomes. – KLN"
2021,passion,honorable mention,Like a Ritual: An Autovisual Ode to Title Fight,Sawyer Click,,https://like-a-ritual.netlify.app/,,,"Sawyer, you had me at “autovisual ode.” As someone who a) works at The Pudding and b) would travel to the ends of the earth for her favorite bands (quite literally), I adore your standom-fueled, geeky-ass analysis into this band and their discography. Kudos for coalescing all those random Spotify variables into a convincing defense of none other than Title Fight. – CR"
2021,passion,honorable mention,Is the Song Intro Dead?,Peter O'Connor,,https://poc275.me/death-of-the-song-intro/,,,"Bit biased here since The Stone Roses are maybe my most-streamed artist so far this year, but I think I speak for all of us at the ol’ Pudding when I say we do love a nerdy data deep-dive to answer a simple yet solid cultural question about music. – CR"

2020,passion,winner,Privacy Preserving Proximity Tracing,"Thomas Haas, Fidel Thomet",,https://tracing.ft0.ch/#/,,https://pudding.cool/process/pudding-cup-2020/assets/images/privacy.jpg,"Explaining a complex topic without conventional charts is usually a recipe for disaster, but this piece pulls it off beautifully. The elegant tracing and pulsing animations paired with well-paced scrollytelling held our attention throughout. In a year filled with top-notch COVID visualizations (we logged over 100 in <a href=https://twitter.com/puddingviz/status/1239619132368265216?s=20>this Twitter thread</a>), this one still managed to stand out."

Or at least we did for this project. The delightful transitions and playful gradients make this a fun read that perfectly complimented the subject matter. This team of two used this project to help them learn D3.js. We’re so excited to see more of their work that seamlessly combines data and design (see also <a href=https://runningincolor.heshlindsdataviz.com/>Running in Color</a>).

When that seismic wave “+” pattern appears on screen it’s an undeniable “aha!” moment. The story structure keeps you scrolling all the way through — this is an excellently executed explainer.
2019,passion,winner,The Unwelcomed,Mohamad A. Waked,,https://alhadaqa.com/the_unwelcomed/,,https://pudding.cool/process/pudding-cup-2019/assets/images/unwelcomed@2x.jpg,One of the critiques that you often hear in data journalism is that the end product can seem cold or clinical. Not this project. You are reminded of the intense emotional and physical journey of migrants and refugees as soon as you read the open lines: “My blue country...” This is a beautiful and thoughtful piece that doesn’t let you forget the story behind the data.

But this project fuses together simplicity, focus, and elegance in a digestible and cohesive package. The histogram paired with the pitch is both attractive and explanatory. While nothing groundbreaking, it has a very clear intention and excellent execution."

2018,passion,,Casting Shakespeare,Eric Lin,,https://ericwilliamlin.com/shakespeare_production_data/,,https://pudding.cool/process/pudding-awards-2018/assets/img/shakespeare.jpg,"Casting Shakespeare is a piece analyzing some of Shakespeare's most well-known work and how the roles themselves affect the casting of actors based on their race and gender. The data visualization not only proved to you how age and gender limit the role of women and people of color in Shakespeare's work, but the annotations also tell you a second story about how directors have broken traditional casting expectations over the years. —Sisi Wei

While other topics may sound more relevant for humanity, this is a story that communicates how much the person who worked on it is passionate about the topic and how interesting he has made it for others. The narration flows in a way that guides you if you don’t know much about the topic, but still lets you explore and get to the fine detail if you care deeply about it. It brings up the little anecdotes and details that makes this dataset more interesting and even funny, in a way that is not intrusive or feels artificial. —Chiqui Esteban

2018,passion,,Twelve years in South Africa's schools,"Laura Grant, Alastair Otter",,https://passmark.org.za/schools/,,https://pudding.cool/process/pudding-awards-2018/assets/img/passmark.jpg,"I'm always looking for a ""whoa"" moment in a data story, and that's what this story delivers. The incremental layering of data guides readers through both the metaphor (dots as students) and the context (what we're looking for.) Then there's a moment near the end of the piece — which I won't ruin — where the authors crystalize the systemic problem with one, concise visual. And with that single gut-wrenching blow, we understand both why this broken South African education system is so devastating. This piece builds a story arc around the data and its subjects, rather than the data scientist and their process, which is important when we try to convey that these spreadsheets describe real-life. This is by no means the most technical or elaborate data story, but it highlights the importance of writing, designing, and editing for an audience. —Alvin Chang"

I’ve theorized on the “country song formula” with countless friends: start with a back road, add in a mud-covered truck, sprinkle in a girl in blue jeans, and top with a brewski.

Breaking down for readers how DeepFakes works — pixel-by-pixel — and using a real world example to ground the software's potential for misuse was both chilling and informative. I also appreciated the way in which the ABC treated the reader as an equal in their journey to discover how DeepFakes works, making it accessible to both a really plugged-in reader and a causal observer. —Sarah Frostenson"

When Nikhil and Thu-Huong analyzed one hundred thousand drawings and broke them out by country, they found deep links between the culture’s dominant alphabet and the way they drew simple shapes. By crisply overlaying the shapes from each country over one another, the visualization presents the claim in a clean, simple manner.

But what’s unique about Xaquín’s approach is the use of a clever hook, “The median salary for women working full-time is about 80 percent of men’s. That gap, put in other terms, means women are working for free 10 weeks a year.” He then uses hand-drawn visuals and graphics to nail this point: time-spent working for free. The rest of the essay then proceeds to debunk commonly held myths, with superb visuals that allow for exploration."
