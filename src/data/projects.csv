2024,passion,winner,Battle of the Chocolate Bars,Surbhi Bhatia,,https://surbhi-bh.github.io/chocolate-wars/,,chocolate.jpg,a bar chart of chocolate bars,"You may have heard that food is better in Europe, compared to the US. This is especially the case for chocolate. We really liked how this project broke down the differences between European and American chocolate standards, annotating ingredient lists and incorporating chocolate imagery into all of the charts. Moreover, readability wasn't lost when chocolate was used in the graphics, which often happens when deviating from typical chart shapes. <span class=judge>—Matt Daniels<span>"
2023,passion,winner,Since When Does Vogue Hate Text?,<a href=https://jessvoiture.github.io/home/>Jess Carr</a>,,https://mag-text.vercel.app/,,magtext.jpg,a strip chart showing the average text on a vogue magazine cover from 2000 (on the left) to 2022 (on the right). the percentages are on the x axis. more recent covers have less text than older covers. this is illustrated by an april 2011 with 25% text coverage featuring rhianna compared to a may 2022 cover featuring rhianna with 6% text coverage.,"I don't read Vogue. I don't remember the last time I even looked at a cover to be honest. Yet, I was instantly captivated by the story. From the jump, the premise and approach were clear and concise. All of the charts presented the right amount of information and stepped through at a very accessible pace. It felt like the author was sharing their journey as they discovered this trend. I knew it was a good piece when I was in the grocery store the next day evaluating the covers on the stand in the checkout aisle. It selfishly left me wanting a tiny bit more; what do the Vogue designers have to say about it, and did other competing magazines follow a similar trend? Maybe a part two is in order... <span class=judge>—Russell Samora</span>"

It is awesome how this piece seamlessly intertwined personal anecdotes of seeing Pavement a bagillion times, data about the band’s reunion tours in general, and viz into an experience that relayed both the history and the chaos (66 songs and 77 shows?!). But, notably, the precise data work that went into parsing decades of setlists and an equally massive discography was seriously impressive — and it was all layered with a design that matched the tone of the project, too. 11/10. <span class=judge>—Caitlyn Ralph</span>"

I keep looking at the rectangles and being amazed that those simple shapes hold so much meaning: the connection to the queer community, how each stripe is a building block for complete representation, and how the absence of color equals the absence of rights. The big idea behind this piece is so well done, but it’s also packed with so many small details — like how the flags reshuffle — that make the user experience more engaging.

I know a technical explainer is only meant for a specific audience, but it was done in a gentle and inviting way. It was clear that every piece of it was thoughtfully considered. The prose was both clear and approachable, the design was simple and clean, and the interactions were playful. There was also a nice balance of passive and active user experience. I appreciated the subtle additions, like toggling to the algorithm view, or dragging the edge handles for deeper control.

Crying at college could have easily been a topic explained in a thousand-word article. However, actually seeing the flood of locations students have cried on campus (in this case, the University of Waterloo) not only makes you understand the topic, but the map-based visualization makes you feel the weight of the topic’s implications (students and academic pressure / stress; even more broadly, young people and mental health).

And with that single gut-wrenching blow, we understand both why this broken South African education system is so devastating. This piece builds a story arc around the data and its subjects, rather than the data scientist and their process, which is important when we try to convey that these spreadsheets describe real-life.

Breaking down for readers how DeepFakes works — pixel-by-pixel — and using a real world example to ground the software's potential for misuse was both chilling and informative. I also appreciated the way in which the ABC treated the reader as an equal in their journey to discover how DeepFakes works, making it accessible to both a really plugged-in reader and a causal observer. <span class=judge>— Sarah Frostenson</span>"

While we seemed to be approaching the saturation point, Denise released this elegant and informational story that eclipsed the rest. There was nothing not to like here; from setting the tone with a browser eclipse, to hooking the reader by contextualizing it from their age perspective. She packed a ton of information and visuals into a tidy presentation."

When Nikhil and Thu-Huong analyzed one hundred thousand drawings and broke them out by country, they found deep links between the culture’s dominant alphabet and the way they drew simple shapes. By crisply overlaying the shapes from each country over one another, the visualization presents the claim in a clean, simple manner. And by pairing each insight with diagrams of the various alphabets, they make a thoroughly convincing case."

2017,staff picks,winner,Can we talk about the gender pay gap?,<a href=https://twitter.com/xocasgv>Xaquín G.V.</a>,<a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/>Washington Post</a>,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/business/women-pay-gap/,,gendergap.jpg,"a conneted scatterplot that shows the gender pay gap. the number of men per profession are represented by a proportional yellow circle. the number of women per profession are represented by a proportional purple cirle. these two circles are connected a magenta line that represented the pay gap. jobs with more women are toward the left and jobs with more men are toward the right. the gender pay gap for pharmacists is $2.70 per hour, for lawyers and other judicial workers it is $9.93 per hour, and for dentists it is $16.97 per hour.","The gender pay gap has been visualized many times. But what’s unique about Xaquín’s approach is the use of a clever hook, “The median salary for women working full-time is about 80 percent of men’s. That gap, put in other terms, means women are working for free 10 weeks a year.” He then uses hand-drawn visuals and graphics to nail this point: time-spent working for free. The rest of the essay then proceeds to debunk commonly held myths, with superb visuals that allow for exploration."
